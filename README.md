Cache results for 1 hour to reduce API requests.
Simple SQLite database integration for caching.
Handles API errors gracefully with informative messages.
Easily extendable and can serve static front-end files.


Technologies Used
Node.js with Express framework
SQLite3 database
Axios for API calls
OpenWeatherMap API for weather data
